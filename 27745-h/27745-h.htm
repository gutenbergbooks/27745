<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>I was induced to make this research by
the late William H. Egle, Librarian of the
State Library at Harrisburg, whose knowledge
of the early history of Pennsylvania
was of valuable assistance to me in preparing
the data for a history of the country
along the Delaware river prior to 1682 (yet
unfinished). Mr. Egle agreed with me that
the claim of Mr. Canby that <span class="smcap">Betsy Ross</span>
designed and made the first flag was legendary
and without that foundation which is so
necessary to uphold claims of this character.
Statements of such a character, when allowed
to go unrefuted, do harm to the history of
any people, inasmuch as they encourage
others to build &ldquo;air castles&rdquo; and purchase
old portraits to be palmed off on others as
<em>our</em> &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; who &ldquo;fit&rdquo; in the Revolution,
or <em>our</em> &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo; who carried
supplies to the troops at Valley Forge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
History is the best incentive to make men
love their country; it encourages that
patriotism which never falters, even at the
cannon&#8217;s mouth. The sight of a flag or the
music of a band merely enthuses as long as
one is in sight or the other can be heard; but
history and its knowledge are lasting and a
source of pride. So, therefore, let it be
true in all its details, no matter who may fall
from the high pedestals upon which they
have been placed by vain-glorious descendants.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN FLAG</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>&ldquo;It will probably never be known who designed
our Union of Stars, the records
of Congress being silent upon the subject,
and there being no mention or suggestion of
it in any of the voluminous correspondence
or diaries of the time, public or private,
which have been published.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Rear-Admiral
Preble</em>.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>So far as regards the adoption of the combination
of stars and stripes, the same assertion
can be safely made. As to the origin
of each this research, it is hoped, will prove
conclusively, first, that colored stripes representing
a combination for a common purpose
were used nearly two hundred years
before the Declaration of Independence;
second, that stars were used in the union of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a flag in November, 1775, on a flag raised
on a Massachusetts privateer commanded by
Captain Manley (see <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>), and that they
were also used in the design of the book plate
of the Washington family along with three
stripes.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the stripes
were made thirteen as a mere matter of sentiment
to represent the colonies engaged in
the Revolutionary struggle. As a matter of
fact, the number thirteen appeared in a large
number of instances during the Revolution,
and was apparently used as an object lesson
to remind the colonists that they were united
in a common cause.</p>

<p>The colors of the stripes have no special
meaning or significance, except that which
anyone may apply who desires to make use
of his imagination, or who may become sentimental
upon the subject. Many have written
and commented upon it; some have said
that the red stripes mean courage, others
war, daring, determination, and so on, and
that the white stripes mean purity, peace,
justice, or equity.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all thy hues were born in heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
As a matter of fact, the idea of stripes in
a flag to represent a combination for a common
purpose originated in 1582 in the Netherlands,
and symbolized the union of the
Dutch Republic in its struggles against the
power of Philip and the persecutions of
Alva.</p>

<p>In a paper read before the New Jersey
Historical Society by a Mr. Haven in January,
1872, he suggested &ldquo;that the combination
of our flag, the stars and stripes, were
favored as a compliment to Washington, because
they were upon the book plate of the
General&#8217;s family.&rdquo; He further stated &ldquo;that
the stars on the book plate were of Roman
origin,&rdquo; and in support quoted from Virgil
&ldquo;Redire ad astra,&rdquo; meaning and inferring
that a return to the stars meant a future
home of peace and happiness for the human
race, and that is what this nation would
eventually become. Assertions and statements
similar to the above may be quoted by
the score, wherein reasons are given based
upon theory and imagination as to the origin
of the devices which compose our national
banner.</p>

<p>The claim that has been made about Betsy
Ross, who worked at upholstering and as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
seamstress during the Revolution, who is
said to have lived in a house either No. 80
or 89 Arch street, Philadelphia, now said to
be No. 239 Arch street, as having some time
in June, 1776, made and designed the first
American flag as we now worship it, cannot
be corroborated by historical research.</p>

<p>The claim is one of that legendary type
that the Rabbins of old handed down for
centuries, and which were believed to be true,
until modern investigation proved their
falsity, or like the imagination of artists
who attempt to paint historical events without
consulting details, historical, and geographical.
The two most notorious in our
history are Leutze&#8217;s painting of Washington
crossing the Delaware, and Benjamin West&#8217;s
painting of William Penn treating with the
Indians. As to the first, I write from authority,
having been designated to represent
the Legislature of Pennsylvania as one of a
committee of three to act in conjunction
with the Trenton Battle Monument Committee
to select an historical subject for the
medallion to be placed upon one of the four
sides of a monument, erected at Trenton, to
represent Pennsylvania&#8217;s part in that memorable
event, we chose as the subject &ldquo;Washington
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Crossing the Delaware,&rdquo; and the result
of our labor, and investigation in conjunction
with the Monument Committee can
be seen to-day on the west side of the monument.
The bronze tablet placed there by
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania truthfully
delineates that notable event. The late
General Stryker, of New Jersey, aided us,
and furnished us books, and documents to
obtain part of the data. The tablet represents
a small rowboat, with General Knox
sitting in the bow of the boat, and Washington
in the stern, the man rowing the boat
was a Mr. Cadwalader. He lived at McKonkey&#8217;s
Ferry, on the Pennsylvania side
of the river. Leutze in his painting has
Washington standing alongside of a horse
in a large scow, such as were used in those
days on the upper Delaware to take produce
to the Philadelphia markets. A number
of others are in the same boat, one holding
aloft a flag containing a blue union with
thirteen white stars&mdash;a flag that did not
come into existence until six months after
the battle was fought.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="caption">flag carried in the revolution
by count pulaski&#8217;s legion</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As to West&#8217;s picture, one need only look
at it, and then read the facts as related in
any history of Pennsylvania, and it will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
found how historically untrue it is. One instance
alone would be sufficient; that is, in
the painting, the vessel in which Penn came
over is anchored out in the river, when, as a
matter of fact, she never came up to Philadelphia.
She was quarantined below Chester
because of the smallpox, and Penn was
rowed up the river from Chester in a small
boat, and landed near the residence of the
Swensons, two Swedes, who lived at Wicaco,
and from whom he bought the land comprising
old Philadelphia. Again, the elm tree
is in full leaf, yet the &ldquo;pow-wow&rdquo; that Penn
held with the Indians took place in November,
and elm trees do not have leaves on them
in this latitude in November. But why digress
from the subject about which I started
to write, merely to show that artists and
those seeking for family distinction are not
to be relied upon as truthful delineators of
history.</p>

<p>The Ross claim is based upon the assertions
set forth in a paper read in 1870 by
Mr. William Canby before the members of
the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. It
was claimed in the paper or essay that from
traditions existing in the Ross family,
Betsy Ross, the grandmother of Mr. Canby
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
on his mother&#8217;s side, was the maker and
designer of the first American flag, and that
she lived on Arch street. A research shows
that a Betsy Ross did live on Arch street;
but the exact location is doubtful, and that
her maiden name was Griscom. She was
married three times, first to John Ross, second
to Ashburn, and lastly to John Claypoole.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 542px;">
<img src="images/img010a.jpg" width="542" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="caption">flag carried in the revolution
by count pulaski&#8217;s legion</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was asserted in the paper read that a
committee of Congress, along with General
Washington, in June, 1776, called at her
house, and engaged her to make a flag from
a rough drawing, which, not suiting her, was
at her suggestion, redrawn by Washington.
From other traditional resources it was also
claimed, that Mrs. Ross changed the stars
from six-pointed to five-pointed. The whole
claim is based upon tales told from memory
by relatives, no other proofs have ever
been found, and a careful and thorough research
fails to discover any. In 1878 a
pamphlet was issued from the printing office
of the State printer at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
written by a Mr. Reigart, based upon
the above claim, and calling Mrs. Ross &ldquo;the
immortal heroine that originated the first
flag of the Union.&rdquo; The book had an alleged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
portrait of Betsy Ross making the first flag;
but it was afterwards discovered that it was
really the portrait of an old Quaker lady
who was living in Lancaster at the time the
book was written. The book was so unreliable
that it made the Ross claim appear
ridiculous in the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Ross made a flag in an Arch street
house, as claimed, it was made after a design
that had been conceived and born somewhere
else, and her contribution was no
more than her labor in sewing on some stars,
the same labor that is given by any girl or
woman who works in a flag manufactory.
Even according to the paper which was read
before the Society in 1870 it is admitted that
a design made by someone else was taken to
her, but that she made certain changes in it.
Now, that is all there is in the Betsy Ross
claim; yet the growing youths of the nation
are being misled and taught an historical
untruth when it is asserted that Mrs. Ross
designed, originated and made the first
American flag, and a lithograph has been
issued showing that historical untruth,
which has not as good a foundation, in fact,
as the two paintings to which I have referred,
because the events sought to be depicted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
in those two cases did happen. All
the sentiment exhibited over the Betsy Ross
story is lost upon those who have looked
the matter up, and are conversant with
the history and growth of our national
emblem, which I will now take up. Those
seeking for more elaborate details are referred
to Bancroft&#8217;s History of the United
States; Lossing&#8217;s Field Book of the Revolution;
Philadelphia Times, April 6, 1877;
The American, The Colonial and the Pennsylvania
Archives; Journals of Congress,
Vols. 1 and 2; Preble&#8217;s History of the Flag;
Cooper&#8217;s Naval History; Life of John Adams;
Hamilton and Sarmiento&#8217;s Histories
of our Flag; Sparks&#8217; and Washington Irving&#8217;s
Lives of Washington; Washington&#8217;s
own letters, diaries and other writings, and
William Cullen Bryant&#8217;s History of the
United States, in which pages 420 and 421
of the third volume he devotes to a history
of the flag, but nowhere does he mention the
Ross claim. He evidently, like myself, could
not find any authority for it, yet his history
was published in 1879&mdash;nine years after the
Ross claim was made. There are many
other authorities, but not one of them gives
her the credit claimed, and all of them except
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
those written since the claim was made, leaving
out the Bryant history, do not even mention
her name.</p>

<p>A claim similar to the one made by Mr.
Canby on behalf of Betsy Ross, was made
by a woman named Elizabeth Montgomery,
daughter of Captain Montgomery, of the
armed Brig <em>Nancy</em>. She claimed that a flag,
&ldquo;stars and stripes,&rdquo; was made early in July,
1776, by a young man on her father&#8217;s brig
while it was in port at St. Thomas; see &ldquo;Reminiscences
of Wilmington, ancient and new,&rdquo;
printed in 1851, on pages 176 to 179; but
her claim it proved to be absolutely false,
as a reference to the American Archives,
vol. vi, page 1132, fourth series, will show
that the Brig <em>Nancy</em>, Captain Montgomery,
was destroyed at Cape May, June 29, 1776,
to keep her from being captured by the
British.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of our Revolutionary
struggle the different colonies had flags of
their own design, which, if grouped together,
would have reminded one of Joseph&#8217;s coat,
embellished with Latin and other mottoes.
At the battle of Bunker Hill the Americans
fought without a flag, although Botta in his
history of the American Revolution says
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
that there was one with the words &ldquo;An Appeal
to Heaven&rdquo; on one side, and the Latin
inscription &ldquo;Qui transtulit sustinet&rdquo; upon
the other (see <a href="#fig1">Fig. 2</a>). In Lossing&#8217;s field
book of the American Revolution, Vol. 1,
page 541, he states that an old lady named
Manning informed him that the Americans
did have a flag at the battle, of which the
field was blue and the union white, having in
it the Red Cross of St. George and a green
pine tree (see <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>); but this cannot be
considered an authority any more than
Trumbull&#8217;s picture of the Battle in the Rotunda
of the capital at Washington. He
depicts the American flag carried in that
battle as something which no one ever saw
or even heard of, to wit: a red flag with a
white union, having in it a green pine tree
(see <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>Frothingham in his history of the siege
of Boston says that there was a flag over
Prescott&#8217;s redoubt having upon it the words
&ldquo;Come if you dare;&rdquo; but there is no authority
given for the statement. As a matter of
fact, it might have been, for at that period
flags were used as ensigns, with different
sentences upon them, such as &ldquo;Liberty and
Union,&rdquo; &ldquo;An Appeal to Heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;Liberty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
or Death,&rdquo; &ldquo;An Appeal to God.&rdquo; Several
such flags were captured by the British and
mentioned in the English journals of that
period (see Figs. <a href="#fig4">5</a>, <a href="#fig12">13</a>, <a href="#fig14">14 and 15</a>). Also
in Powell&#8217;s picture of the battle of Lake
Erie in the national capital Perry is seen
in a boat with a flag of thirteen stripes and
thirteen stars; yet when the battle was
fought the American flag consisted of fifteen
stripes and fifteen stars, and had been
so constituted since 1794, because under an
act of Congress there was to be a stripe and
a star added for the two States admitted
after the thirteen colonies became States, to
wit: Kentucky and Vermont. So Congress
on the 13th day of January, 1794, passed
an act fixing the number of stripes and stars
at fifteen, and such was the Star-Spangled
Banner that Key saw at Fort McHenry in
the &ldquo;dim morning&#8217;s light&rdquo; when he wrote
the words of our National Hymn, as a
matter of fact, the war of 1812 was fought
under a flag of fifteen stripes and fifteen
stars. In 1878, at a fair in Boston, the flag
of the United States brig &ldquo;Enterprise,&rdquo; that
fought the English brig &ldquo;Boxer&rdquo; on September
15, 1813, was exhibited. It had fifteen
stripes and fifteen stars. It belongs to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a Mr. Quincy, of Portland, Maine. It was
not until the 4th day of April, 1818, that
Congress passed the act fixing the number
of stripes, alternating red and white, at thirteen,
to represent the thirteen original colonies,
and a blue union with a white star for
every State then in the Federal Union, and
for those that would be admitted an extra
star to be added on the 4th day of July after
the admission of the State. Now, by a late
act, the State is not admitted until the 4th
day of July after the passage of the act admitting
her to statehood. The act reads as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;An Act to establish the flag of the United
States. Sec. 1. Be it enacted, etc., that
from and after the fourth day of July next
the flag of the United States be thirteen
stripes alternate red and white; that the
union have twenty stars white in a blue field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sec. 2. And be it further enacted that,
on the admission of every new State into the
Union, one star be added to the union of the
flag; and that such addition shall take effect
on the fourth of July next succeeding such
admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Approved April 4, 1818.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
The use of stars by the Colonies on their
flags was first suggested by a little piece of
poetry in a newspaper called the &ldquo;Massachusetts
Spy,&rdquo; published in Boston on March
the 10th, 1774. It was as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.4em;">&ldquo;A ray of bright glory</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now beams from afar;</span><br />

   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now sparkles a star.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>This piece of poetry was the cause of a
flag being made in 1775 by a patriotic vessel
owner of Massachusetts having thirteen
white stars on it in a blue union, the body of
the flag being white, with an anchor upon it
having over the top the word &ldquo;HOPE&rdquo;
(see <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>), already mentioned. It was
hoisted on the armed schooner Lee, Captain
John Manley (see also Rhode Island Colonial
Records, Vol. X, p. 14. A similar flag is
now in the office of the Secretary of State.
It was carried by a Rhode Island regiment
during the Revolution). Either this or the
stars on the Washington book plate, in the
absence of any record, may be taken as reasons
for the adoption of the stars in the
union in place of the crosses of St. Andrew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and St. George. I have also referred to the
claim that the combination of the stars and
stripes was probably adopted out of love and
respect for Washington. If this claim is
true, then we would have, according to the
Ross claim the spectacle of Washington
complimenting and honoring himself, when,
as a matter of fact, his whole life disproves
such conduct on his part. Now, let us see
if this argument as to the origin of the combination
is born out by facts. We find in a
book printed in London in 1704 by J. Beaumont
that the English East India Company
had a flag of thirteen red and white stripes
alternating (see <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>) the same as ours,
only it had the red cross of St. George in a
white union. In 1705 they reduced the
stripes to ten; but in another work on ship-building,
published in 1705, by Carl Allard in
Amsterdam, we find that he fixes the number
of stripes at nine. Also in a book published
by Le Haye in 1737 we find that the
number of striped flags in existence in Europe
were as follows: Bremen, nine stripes,
red and white, with a union of four squares,
same colors; Rotterdam, eleven stripes, red
and green; North Holland, thirteen stripes,
red and yellow; East India Company, thirteen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
stripes, red and white, with a white
union and St. George Cross, already mentioned.
But no matter as to the number of
stripes, it is thus conclusively shown that
thirteen red and white stripes were in use
seventy years before they were adopted by
the American Colonies. In October, 1775,
while the English troops were besieged in
Boston by the troops under Washington, it
became apparent that we should have some
sort of a flag to represent the Colonies in the
aggregate, and show thereby that they were
acting in concert; so a committee was appointed,
of which Benjamin Franklin was
the chairman. It was determined that the
flag should be called the Grand Union Flag,
and that it should have thirteen red and
white stripes alternating to represent the
thirteen Colonies, and the crosses of St.
George and St. Andrew in the union to attest
their loyalty to the Crown (see <a href="#fig6">Fig. 7</a>),
as at that period national sovereignty was
not contemplated. The quarrel as claimed
was simply over the right to be represented
in the taxing body of the British nation.
Preble in his history of the flag says, on page
225, as to the stripes being used at the instance
of Washington:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
&ldquo;Without further seeking for the origin
for the stripes upon our flag, it is possible that
the stripes on his own escutcheon suggested
them. They were also on the flag of the
Philadelphia Light-horse that escorted him
on the road to Cambridge from Philadelphia
as far as New York in 1775&rdquo; (see <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a>).
This latter flag is in Philadelphia, and is the
property of the Philadelphia First City
Troop. The Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch
in 1871 gave a very interesting history of it.
Messrs. Lynch and Harrison were Franklin&#8217;s
colleagues on the committee. In November,
1775, they met at Cambridge in Washington&#8217;s
headquarters, and, after carefully considering
all the facts, adopted the Grand
Union Flag above described. &ldquo;The Union
Jack&rdquo; was called &ldquo;the king&#8217;s colors&rdquo; because
of the crosses to which allusion has
been made. The first flag that was made,
there being no record of the name of the
maker, was hoisted over Washington&#8217;s headquarters
at Cambridge on the second day of
January, 1776. In a letter to Mr. Reed,
dated the 4th day of January, Washington
wrote that &ldquo;the saluting of this flag by cannon
and musketry fire gave rise to a ridiculous
idea on the part of the British in Boston,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
who, that day having received copies of the
king&#8217;s speech to Parliament, supposed that
the Colonial troops had also received copies,
and that the salute was in honor of the king,
and that the rebellious Colonists had submitted.&rdquo;
So, first, as early as the 2d day of January,
1776, the flag we all love except the
blue union and white stars, was in existence.
Second. We have the names of the men who
designed it. Third. That it was raised at
Cambridge. Fourth. The reasons why the
combination was adopted; and fifth, that its
first raising was an official act.... So
therefore we now have to deal only with the
change of the union from the crosses to the
stars; and this is best arrived at by following
the history of the navy of that time:</p>

<p>The navy of the Colonies in 1775 consisted
of armed vessels, either maintained by private
enterprise, by the Councils, Boards of
War, or Navy Boards of the different colonies,
the general Congress making no provisions
for the establishment of a colonial
navy until October 13, 1775, when, after a
general debate based upon the report of a
committee, the following resolution was
adopted (see Journal of Congress, Vol. 1,
p. 204):</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<em>Resolved</em>, That a swift sailing vessel to
carry the carriage guns and a proportionate
number of swivels, with eighty men, be fitted
with all possible dispatch for a cruise of
three months.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>After discussion it was further</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<em>Resolved</em>, That another vessel be fitted
for the same purpose, and that a marine
committee, consisting of Messrs. Dean,
Langdon and Gadsden, report their opinion
of a proper vessel and also an estimate of
the expense.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Two days later, October 20, 1775, Washington
wrote a letter suggesting to the Congress
that a flag be adopted, so that &ldquo;the
vessels may know one another.&rdquo; This idea
was a flag with a white ground, a tree in the
middle, and the sentence: &ldquo;An Appeal to
Heaven&rdquo; on it (see <a href="#fig1">Fig. 2</a>, already mentioned).</p>

<p>Four days afterwards the committee made
a report, but it was not accepted, and the
above resolution was recommitted. On the
30th of October the committee made a report
recommending more vessels, and four more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
members were added to the Committee&mdash;Mr.
Hopkins, Mr. Hewes, R. H. Lee and
John Adams. At a session of Congress on
the 9th of November, 1775, a resolution
was passed authorizing the creation of two
battalions of marines. They were to be composed
only of those acquainted with seamanship.
This same committee on the 23d
of November reported certain rules for the
government of the navy, which were adopted
on the 28th (see journal of Congress 1, page
255). On the 2d of December the committee
was authorized to prepare a commission
for the captains of armed vessels in colonial
service. On December 9th the pay of naval
officers, marines and seamen was adopted,
and on December 11th a committee was appointed
of one from each colony as a Committee
of Ways and Means on Naval affairs.
This committee reported on the 13th that a
number of vessels could be prepared for sea
by March, 1776, and that it would cost over
eight hundred thousand dollars to purchase
them and fit them out. This report was
adopted, and the same committee was ordered
to go ahead and prepare the vessels for sea,
which was accordingly done, and the following
vessels were made ready for service:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Alfred, Dorea, Columbus, Lexington, Fly,
Hornet, Wasp, Cabot, Randolph, Franklin,
Providence, Dolphin and Lynch.</p>

<p>In April, 1776, the council of the Massachusetts
Colony adopted a device for a flag for
privateers, and its own armed vessels a white
flag with a green pine tree on it (see <a href="#fig1">Fig. 2</a>);
but the general Congress made no provision
whatever for a naval flag distinct from the
Grand Union Flag hoisted in January at
Cambridge, as stated. In July, 1776, John
Jay complained in a letter that Congress had
fixed upon no device &ldquo;concerning continental
colors, and that captains of the armed
vessels had followed their own fancies.&rdquo; In
the latter part of 1775, M. Turgot, the French
Premier of Louis XVI received a report
from an agent of his kept in the Colonies that
&ldquo;they have given up the English flag, and
have taken as their devices a rattlesnake
with thirteen rattles, or a mailed arm holding
thirteen arrows.&rdquo; The reason given
for the maintenance of an agent by the
French government was to assure the Colonists
that they were esteemed and respected
by the French people. The ulterior purpose,
however, of Vergennes and Turgot was to
recover back if they could the Canadian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
provinces they had lost in their war with the
British. Many such flags were in use, and
some were embellished with mottoes the
principal one being &ldquo;Don&#8217;t tread on me.&rdquo;
Such a motto was upon the flag of Proctor&#8217;s
Westmoreland County Battalion of Pennsylvania
(see <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>). This flag was displayed
at the centennial of Westmoreland County,
Pennsylvania, at Greensburg, held in the year
1873. A splendid cut of the above flag is
in Vol. XIV of the Archives of Pennsylvania.
Others had upon them a rattlesnake broken
into thirteen pieces with the mottoes of
&ldquo;Unite or die,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Join or die.&rdquo; These
devices were first used to stimulate the Colonies
into concerted action against the French
and Indians, and afterwards were revived to
unite them in the Revolutionary struggle.
In Bradford&#8217;s Pennsylvania Journal of December
27, 1775, there appeared the following
article, which is very interesting and logical:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Messrs. Printers</span>: I
observed on one of the drums belonging to the marines, now
raising, there was painted a rattlesnake, with
this modest motto under it, &ldquo;Don&#8217;t tread on
me!&rdquo; As I know it is the custom to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
some device on the arms of every country, I
supposed this might be intended for the arms
of North America. As I have nothing to
do with public affairs, and as my time is perfectly
my own, in order to divert an idle
hour I sat down to guess what might have
been intended by this uncommon device. I
took care, however, to consult on this occasion
a person acquainted with heraldry, from
whom I learned that it is a rule among the
learned in that science that the worthy properties
of an animal in a crest shall be considered,
and that the base one cannot be intended.
He likewise informed me that the
ancients considered the serpent as an emblem
of wisdom, and, in a certain attitude, of endless
duration; both of which circumstances,
I suppose, may have been in view. Having
gained this intelligence, and recollecting that
countries are sometimes represented by animals
peculiar to them, it occurred to me that
the rattlesnake is found in no other quarter
of the globe than American, and it may
therefore have been chosen on that account
to represent her. But then the worthy properties
of a snake, I judged, would be hard
to point out. This rather raised than suppressed
my curiosity, and having frequently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
seen the rattlesnake, I ran over in my mind
every property for which she was distinguished,
not only from other animals, but
from those of the same genus or class, endeavoring
to fix some meaning to each not
wholly inconsistent with common sense. I
recollected that her eyes exceeded in brightness
that of any other animal, and that she
had no eyelids. She may therefore be esteemed
an emblem of vigilance. She never
begins an attack, nor, when once engaged,
ever surrenders. She is therefore an emblem
of magnanimity and true courage. As
if anxious to prevent all pretensions of quarreling
with the weapons with which nature
favored her, she conceals them in the roof
of her mouth, so that, to those who are unacquainted
with her, she appears most defenceless;
and even when those weapons are
shown and extended for defence, they appear
weak and contemptible; but their
wounds, however small, are decisive and
fatal. Conscious of this, she never wounds
until she has generously given notice even to
her enemy, and cautioned him against the
danger of treading on her. Was I wrong,
sirs, in thinking this a strong picture of the
temper and conduct of America?</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The poison of her teeth is the necessary
means of digesting her food, and, at the
same time, is the certain destruction of her
enemies. This may be understood to intimate
that those things which are destructive
to our enemies may be to us not only harmless,
but absolutely necessary to our existence.
I confess I was totally at a loss what
to make of the rattles until I counted them,
and found them just thirteen&mdash;exactly the
number of colonies united in America; and
I recollected, too, that this was the only part
of the snake which increased in numbers.
Perhaps it may have only been my fancy,
but I conceited the painter had shown a half-formed
additional rattle, which, I suppose,
may have been intended to represent the
province of Canada. &#8217;Tis curious and
amazing to observe how distinct and independent
of each other the rattles of this animal
are, and yet how firmly they are united
together, so as to be never separated except
by breaking them to pieces. One of these
rattles singly is incapable of producing
sound; but the ringing of thirteen together
is sufficient to alarm the boldest man living.
The rattlesnake is solitary, and associates
with her kind only when it is necessary for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
her preservation. In winter the warmth of
a number together will preserve their lives,
whilst singly they would probably perish.
The power of fascination attributed to her
by a generous construction may be understood
to mean that those who consider the
liberty and blessings which America affords,
and once come over to her, never afterwards
leave her, but spend their lives with her.
She strongly resembles America in this:
that she is beautiful in youth, and her beauty
increases with age; her tongue also is blue,
and forked as lightning, and her abode is
among impenetrable rocks.</p>

<p>Having pleased myself with reflections
of this kind, I communicated my sentiments
to a neighbor of mine, who has a surprising
readiness at guessing any thing which relates
to public affairs; and, indeed, I should
be jealous of his reputation in that way, were
it not that the event constantly shows that he
has guessed wrong. He instantly declared
it his sentiment that Congress meant to allude
to Lord North&#8217;s declaration in the
House of Commons that he never would relax
his measures until he had brought America
to his feet, and to intimate to his Lordship
that, if she was brought to his feet, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
would be dangerous treading on her. But
I am positive he has guessed wrong; for I
am sure Congress would not, at this time
of day, condescend to take the least notice
of his Lordship in that or any other way. In
which opinion I am determined to remain
your humble servant.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>On the 8th day of February, 1776, one of
the committee on naval affairs, Mr. Gadsden,
who represented South Carolina in the
General Congress, presented that body with
a flag that was made of yellow silk with a
rattlesnake upon it (see Drayton&#8217;s American
Revolution, Vol. II, page 172; see <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>).
No one can tell what became of this
flag, yet it was placed in the hall of Congress
in a conspicuous place near the seat of John
Hancock. Some claim that it was this flag
that Paul Jones hoisted on his ship, and
others that it was taken South to Fort Moultrie.
So therefore we have, as late as April,
1776, a navy of seventeen vessels, proper
committees of Congress to look after them,
a commander-in-chief, to wit: Esek Hopkins,
who was named for that position December
22, 1775; but no national flag had
been made nor one even adopted in July,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
1776 (see Jay&#8217;s letter to the committee), nor
in October (see Richard&#8217;s letter, dated October
15, 1776), both written months after the
date fixed upon in the Ross claim; but the
supposition is that, so far as the navy is concerned,
it either flew the Grand Union or a
flag similar to the Gadsden device, and this
is borne out by the records. As to who was
the first naval officer to raise the first American
flag to the peak of his vessel and capture
the first prize, we only have to quote ex-President
John Adams, who wrote from
Quincy in 1813 to Vice-president Gerry as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Philadelphia is now boasting that Paul
Jones has asserted in his journal that his
hand first hoisted the first American flag,
and Captain Barry has asserted that the first
British flag was struck to him. Now, I assert
that the first American flag was hoisted
by Captain John Manley and the first British
flag was struck to him on the 29th day of
November, 1775.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>As Captain Barry did not go to sea in the
Lexington until February, 1776, therefore
this claim of President John Adams is undeniably
true so far as regards Barry, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the records show that Manley, in a schooner
called the Lee, captured the British vessel
Nancy, bound to Boston, loaded with munitions
of war for the use of the British troops
besieged there, and among the articles captured
was a mortar, which afterwards was
used on Dorchester Heights by Washington&#8217;s
troops in shelling the British in Boston.
This same captain on the 8th of December,
1775, captured two more British transports
loaded with provisions.</p>

<p>The Paul Jones claim rests upon not that
his was the first vessel to hoist an American
flag, but that the Alfred was the first commissioned
United States war vessel to hoist
the Grand Union Flag; but there is no record
anywhere of the date, and as no naval
commission was issued to Jones until December
7, 1775, the Manley claim made by
Adams stands alone as regards the first
American flag distinct from the English
standard as changed by the Colonists; and it
is also corroborated by a letter sent by General
Howe on December 13, 1775, while he
was besieged in Boston to Lord Davenport,
complaining about Manley&#8217;s capture of the
Nancy with four thousand stands of arms.
Now, I claim that Adams could not have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
meant the Grand Union Flag, as it was not
agreed upon until December, 1775, but the
one I have described as having a blue union
with white stars, a white ground with an
anchor and the word &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; over the
anchor (see <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). The Lee was an
armed privateer. In a letter to Robert Morris,
October, 1783, Jones, in speaking of the
flag, made the claim that &ldquo;the flag of America&rdquo;
was displayed on a war vessel for the
first time by him, he then being a lieutenant
on the Alfred; but there is no record as to
whether it was a Continental or Grand Union
Flag, or some other device; yet there are reasons
to suppose it was the Grand Union Flag&mdash;first,
because the Alfred was in the port
of Philadelphia, and we find from the record
(American Archives, Vol. IV, page 179)
that the day signal of the fleets on February
17, 1776, at the Capes of the Delaware were
to be made by using the &ldquo;Grand Union Flag
at the mizzen peak,&rdquo; which was to be lowered
or hoisted according to the information intended
to be given under the code of signals
furnished.</p>

<p>In the <em>Ladies&#8217; Magazine</em>, published in London,
May 13, 1776, the writer states that the
colors of the American navy were &ldquo;first a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
flag with a union and thirteen stripes, and
the commander&#8217;s flag a yellow flag with a
rattlesnake upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the Pennsylvania <em>Evening Post</em> of June
20, 1776, was published a letter stating that
the British cruiser Roebuck had captured
two prizes in Delaware Bay &ldquo;which she decoyed
by hoisting a Continental Union Flag.&rdquo;
There is no doubt that from July 4, 1776,
until June 14, 1777, we had as a national ensign
simply a flag with thirteen stripes, as
we had declared ourselves free from the government
represented by the crosses of St.
George and St. Andrew which we had hitherto
on our flag, but having upon it a snake
with the motto already so often mentioned
of &ldquo;Don&#8217;t tread on me,&rdquo; and this design was
used, but without any official action being
taken thereon by the General Congress (see <a href="#fig10">Fig. 11</a>);
yet from May, 1776, or June, 1776,
the date fixed upon in the Ross claim, until
May, 1777, the American troops fought the
following battles: June 28, 1776, Fort
Moultrie. The flag in that engagement was
a blue flag with a crescent and the word
&ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; upon it (see <a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>). Battle of
Long Island, August 2, 1776, the British
captured a flag of red damask with the word
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
&ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; on it; September 16th, Harlem
Plains, no flag being mentioned; October
28th, the battle of White Plains, the flag carried
by the Americans was a white flag with
two cross-swords on it and the words &ldquo;Liberty
or death;&rdquo; November 16th, surrender
of Fort Washington, no mention of a flag;
December 26th, battle of Trenton, the flags
in this battle were State flags; all other
claims are the imagination of artists who
apparently knew nothing of the history of
the flag; January 3d, Princeton, the same as
at Trenton; January 26th, Tryon&#8217;s attack on
Danbury; and yet in all these engagements
that took place after we had declared ourselves
a free and independent people there is
no record in existence, public or private, that
the flag claimed to have been designed by
Mrs. Ross in May or June, 1776, was carried.
The first time the Stars and Stripes
was carried by American troops of which we
have any positive record was at the battle of
the Brandywine, in September, 1777.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent in 1776 that we
were fighting for more than mere Parliamentary
representation, and when the culmination
was reached by the adoption of the
Declaration of Independence on the 4th day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of July, 1776, the conclusion was also reached
that we could not consistently fight under a
standard containing in its union the crosses
of St. Andrew and St. George, devices that
belonged to the enemy, but which we had
used, to express our loyalty to the king up
to that time while fighting for a principle.
The want of a change in our emblem as originally
adopted can be best appreciated by the
contents of a letter dated October 15, 1776,
sent by William Richards to the Committee
of Safety, published in the Pennsylvania
Archives, Vol. 5, page 46, wherein, <em>inter alia</em>,
he said: &ldquo;The Commodore was with me this
morning, and says that the fleet has no colors
to hoist if they should be called on duty. <em>It
is not in my power to get them until there
is a design fixed on to make the colors by.</em>&rdquo;
Yet this letter was written four months after
the time fixed in the alleged Betsy Ross
claim. Thus it is shown conclusively by the
record that we had dropped the old Grand
Union or Continental Flag, to wit: the
Crosses and the Stripes, but had not yet, October,
1776, adopted a new design, and it was
not until June 14, 1777, one year after the
time fixed as to the Ross claim, that a new
design was adopted, and a resolution was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
passed wherein Congress said &ldquo;that the Flag
of the Thirteen United States be thirteen
stripes alternate red and white, that the
union be thirteen stars white on a blue field,
representing a new constellation.&rdquo; In the
rough Journal of Congress the word &ldquo;of&rdquo;
occurs before the words &ldquo;thirteen stripes;&rdquo;
in the record it appears to have been changed,
thus corroborating the former use of the
thirteen stripes.</p>

<p>There is no record as to how this resolution
got before Congress&mdash;whether a member
introduced it, or whether it was the outcome
of the report of a committee. No official
proclamation of this resolution was made
until September, 1777; but it was printed in
the papers previous to that time as an item of
news; so, therefore, from June to September,
1777, private enterprise may have made
many of them. The Ross claim is ridiculous
when it contends that Washington, Col. Ross
and Robert Morris, in June, 1776, one month
before the Declaration of Independence had
been adopted, called on Betsy Ross, and that
Washington drew with a pencil a rough
drawing of the present American flag, she
making the stars five-pointed. The statement
is without any documentary or record
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
proof. As a matter of fact the six-pointed
star was not adopted because of its use in
English heraldry, while in Holland and
France, our allies, five-pointed stars were
used. Now, as to the claim that &ldquo;Old Glory&rdquo;
was thus made in 1776 by Betsy Ross, what
became of it? Preble says of Canby: &ldquo;I
cannot agree with his claim, and neither
does the record support it&rdquo; ... and besides
it is practically charging Washington and
the rest of the committee with seeking to
establish and set up a national ensign before
we had even declared ourselves a free people
with an independent national government,
and without any delegated authority to do
so, the record of Congress being silent on
the subject; so therefore we have: <em>First.</em>
On October 15, 1776, the letter of William
Richards to the Committee of Safety already
quoted <em>shows that the Ross claim cannot
be true</em>. In fact, at the time the letter was
written we had no colors nor was any designed.
<em>Second.</em> That at the time it is alleged
the committee called on Mrs. Ross we
had no national existence. We were still
simply revolting colonies, not yet having declared
our independence. <em>Third.</em> As a climax
I have found in the Pennsylvania Archives,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
2d series, Vol. 1, page 164, the following
extract from the Pennsylvania (not the
Colonies) Navy Board&#8217;s minutes, May 29,
1777, being the first bill for colors for the
fleet on record:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Present: William Bradford, Joseph
Marsh, Joseph Blewer, Paul Cox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An order on William Webb to Elizabeth
Ross for fourteen pounds, twelve shillings
and two pence for making ships&#8217; colors, etc.,
put into William Richards&#8217; store, &pound;14.12.2.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><em>Fourth.</em> Also in May, 1777, the State of
Massachusetts knew nothing of a national
ensign of the Ross description, as seen by
the following bill paid by the Board of War
of that State to Joseph Webb: &ldquo;To mending
an ensign and sewing in pine tree, 6<em>s.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;May &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, State of Mass., Pay to
Jos. Webb, Dr. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 1777. To making

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="caption">flag carried in the revolution
by the first regiment<br />
of the pennsylvania line</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<em>Fifth.</em> If Washington and the others had
agreed on a design in June, 1776, as Mr.
Canby claims, Washington would have had
it officially adopted, because he above all men
knew the necessity of a national emblem, and
more especially would he have done so immediately
after the adoption of the Declaration
of Independence in July following, and
he would not then have fought at Trenton
and Princeton in December, 1776, under the
State ensigns, or at Long Island or White
Plains under the flags mentioned.</p>

<p><em>Sixth.</em> The first official record of the Stars
and Stripes being carried in battle was at the
Brandywine in September, 1777, although
it is claimed that at Oriskany, fought on the
22d day of August, 1777, when Fort Stanwix
was invested by the British, an American
flag was made by using white shirts, a red
petticoat and Captain Abraham Swartout&#8217;s
blue coat (see Lossing&#8217;s field book of the
American Revolution, Vol. 1, page 242; also
Preble&#8217;s Origin of the Flag, page 276).</p>

<p><em>Seventh.</em> In view of the above-recorded
facts, the Betsy Ross story fails to convince
the student and searcher after historical facts
as to its authenticity. It is &ldquo;the imagination
of the artist&rdquo; told in story. He says: &ldquo;I fix
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the date because Washington at that time
was in Philadelphia;&rdquo; but no one else fixes
the date of the Betsy Ross incident, not
even the relatives from whom it is claimed
the story was obtained. And further in the
same statement it says: &ldquo;Washington came
to confer upon the affairs of the army, the
flag being no doubt one of these affairs.&rdquo;
Mere guess-work. And if a true guess, then
the argument already used by Preble as to
what became of the design and the flag from
that time, June, 1776, to June, 1777, holds
good. It was further claimed that stars and
stripes were in general use a year before Congress
adopted them; but it fails <em>to show one
instance to sustain the assertion</em>; besides,
the Richards letter of October, 1776, <em>it being
official, completely upsets the claim</em>. Washington
Irving in his life of Washington says
that the General, accompanied by Mrs.
Washington, left New York on the 21st day
of May, 1776, and that they were the guests
of John Hancock while in Philadelphia; but
neither Irving, Sparks, nor any other writers
of Washington&#8217;s life mention anything whatever
of the Ross incident. If it happened, it
surely would have been mentioned by someone.
Even Washington himself fails to say
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
anything about it in any of the letters he has
written, his diaries, or statements made, nor
are there any allusions to the subject in the
published correspondence of his contemporaries.
So therefore the Ross claim simply
rests on the statements claimed to have been
obtained from relatives, while against it are
the various facts above given and hundreds
of others not mentioned in this article.</p>

<p>Our flag is the representative of national
unity, equal and exact justice to all men. It
stands for no sentimental characteristic. It
is a practical exhibition in itself of the result
of concerted action, and has been from its
origin until to-day worshipped as no other
ensign designed by man has ever been. It
is loved and respected by all who love liberty.
It represents the government. It represents
our honor. To love it is to love one&#8217;s country,
a duty more sacred than any other, except
love and respect for God.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.4em;">&ldquo;Oh, glorious flag! red, white and blue,</span><br />
 Bright emblem of the pure and true!<br />
 Oh, glorious group of clustering stars,<br />
 Ye lines of light, ye crimson bars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our flag upon the ocean has been the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
theme for many a song and story, and in the
early days of the Republic the achievements
of our naval heroes were looked upon as
more essential for the attainment of our liberties
than victories on shore, as every vessel
captured or destroyed meant the loss of
stores and munitions of war to the British
troops, hence early in the struggle, as before
stated, private enterprise took the first steps
in creating a navy, then the colonies took it
up separately, and then, as stated, the General
Congress.</p>

<p>The Delaware River was the scene of more
activity in that direction than any other port
of the Colonies, a reputation which it still
enjoys. A large number of vessels were
fitted out, and here it was the first fleet of
American war vessels gathered, and from
the Delaware sailed the first commissioned
war vessel to cruise on the ocean, the Lexington,
Commodore John Barry. Of course,
there had been many, as I have stated, private
and colonial vessels that had been at sea
since the Lee, Captain John Manley (<em>ad
supra</em>), in the autumn of 1775, sailed from a
Massachusetts port, and I have no doubt that
many of these private and colonial vessels
flew the Grand Union Flag after it had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
adopted. So therefore it is fair to presume
from the records that Lieutenant Paul Jones
was the first commissioned officer to raise
it to the peak of a <em>commissioned American
war vessel</em>, the Alfred; that Captain John
Barry was the first to take it to sea on the
Lexington, and that the first to exhibit it to
other countries was Captain Wickes, of the
brig Reprisal, who arrived at St. Eustatia on
July 27, 1776 (see American Archives, 5th
series, Vol. 1, page 610). The flag he displayed
had thirteen stripes and a union of
yellow or white; but whether it had on it
crosses, pine trees or rattlesnakes no one can
tell, as no record can be found; but it is supposed
to have been a yellow union with a
rattlesnake on it (see <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>), as the naval
flag had been a yellow flag with a rattlesnake
on it, with thirteen rattles and one budding,
and the motto &ldquo;Don&#8217;t tread on me.&rdquo; It was
also claimed to have been displayed in the
same port on November 16, 1776, and to
have received its first salute from a foreign
power. In looking the matter up it was discovered
that the American brig Andrew
Dorea was in the port named on that day,
she having sailed from Philadelphia in September,
1776. On her arrival she saluted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the fort, and the Dutch commander returned
it, and he was afterwards dismissed by his
government for doing so. So, therefore, it
is fair to infer that both claims are made
upon a foundation of facts that are corroborated
by the records. But the Reprisal&#8217;s
flag must have been the Grand Union or Continental
flag, as she left port before the
adoption of the Declaration of Independence,
while the Dorea must have had some other
design for a flag, as she did not sail until
September, two months after the Declaration
was adopted. Besides, in a letter from
St. Eustatia, published in the American Archives,
Vol. 2, 5th series, page 760, it said:
&ldquo;All American vessels here now wear the
Congress colors.&rdquo; As the crosses of St.
Andrew and St. George had been dropped,
the Congress colors must have been simply
an ensign of thirteen red and white stripes,
with an emblem of a rattlesnake on it (see <a href="#fig10">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>The second salute from a foreign power
to our flag of which we have any record was
given at Brest by the French commander in
August, 1777, to the General Mifflin, Captain
McNeill. It must have been the Congress
flag, as the news of the passage of the act of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
June 14th creating the Stars and Stripes
could not have been known by those on the
Mifflin, as in those days we had no merchant
marine or other means except through armed
vessels of communicating with other countries.</p>

<p>The galleys on the Delaware were in
charge of the Pennsylvania Committee of
Safety. They had no colors to hoist in August,
1776, as can be seen by the following
letter of Mr. Richards, dated the 19th of that
month. It was directed to the committee,
and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I hope you have agreed what sort of colors
I am to have made for the galleys, as
they are much wanted.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>And this was two months after the alleged
date of the Ross claim. The following letter
will give a description of the sailing of
the first fleet of war vessels this government
ever owned:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style="margin-left: 30em;">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Newbern</span>, N. C., Feb. 9, 1776.
</p>

<p>&ldquo;By a gentleman from Philadelphia, we
have received the pleasing account of the
actual sailing from that place of the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
American fleet that ever swelled their sails
on the western ocean in defense of the rights
and liberties of the people of these Colonies,
now suffering under the persecuting rod of
the British ministry, and their more than
brutish tyrants in America. This fleet consists
of five sail, fitted out from Philadelphia,
which are to be joined at the capes of Virginia
by two ships more from Maryland, and
is commanded by Admiral Hopkins, a most
experienced and venerable sea captain. The
admiral&#8217;s ship is called the Columbus, after
Christopher Columbus, thirty-six guns, 12
and 9-pounders, on two decks, forty swivels
and five hundred men. The second ship is
called the Cabot, after Sebastian Cabot, who
completed the discoveries of America made
by Columbus, and mounts thirty-two guns.
The others are smaller vessels, from twenty-four
to fourteen guns. They sailed from
Philadelphia amidst the acclamations of
many thousands assembled on the joyful occasion,
under the display of a Union flag
with thirteen stripes in a field, emblematical
of the thirteen united colonies; but, unhappily
for us, the ice in the river Delaware as
yet obstructs the passage down; but the time
will now soon arrive when this fleet must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
come to action. Their destination is a secret,
but generally supposed to be against the ministerial
governors, those little petty tyrants
that have lately spread fire and sword
throughout the Southern colonies. For the
happy success of this little fleet three millions
of people offer their most earnest supplications
to heaven.&rdquo; See American Archives,
4th series, Vol. IV, page 964; also
Cooper&#8217;s Naval History as to who named
the vessels. John Adams claimed that
honor. See American Archives, 4th series,
Vol. IV, p. 964.</p></div>

<p>The fleet made a descent upon New Providence,
and, after capturing the place and
taking away a large quantity of munitions
of war and stores, it left and coasted along
the coast from Cape Cod to Cape Charles,
making many captures. On the 17th of
April, 1776, occurred the first engagement
between an English war vessel and a commissioned
American war vessel. The English
vessel was the brig Edward, mounting
sixteen four-pounders, and, by a strange coincidence,
the American vessel was the Lexington,
Captain Barry. It was at Lexington
on land in April, 1775, the first shot was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
fired by Americans, and it was from the
Lexington at sea that the first broadside
was delivered at the &ldquo;Wooden Walls&rdquo; of
old England. The fight resulted in the capture
of the British vessel.</p>

<p>No one can tell in the absence of a record
the name of the vessel to first fly the Stars
and Stripes. Paul Jones claimed it for the
Alliance; but in Cooper&#8217;s life of Paul Jones,
page 31, occurs the following. Speaking
of Jones&#8217; claim, he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may have been mistaken. He always
claimed to have been the first man to
hoist the flag of 1775 (the Grand Union)
in a national ship, and the first man to show
the present ensign (the Stars and Stripes)
on board of a man-of-war. This may be
true or not. There was a weakness about
the character of the man that rendered him
a little liable to self-delusions of this nature;
and while it is probable he was right as to
the flag which was shown before Philadelphia
on the Alfred (the Grand Union) the
place where Congress was sitting, it is by
no means as reasonable to suppose that the
first of the permanent flags (Stars and
Stripes) was shown at a place as distant as
Portsmouth. The circumstances are of no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
moment, except as they serve to betray a
want of simplicity of character, that was
rather a failing with the man, and his avidity
for personal distinction of every sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To corroborate Cooper I have only to
state that Jones&#8217; claim is absurd when, as a
matter of fact, the Alliance was not launched
until 1777, and Jones did not command her
until 1779, when, as a matter of course, she
must have carried the Stars and Stripes
(see MacKensie&#8217;s Life of Jones, Vol. 1,
pages 252 and 253). Much to our regret,
as lovers of our country, we must admit that
the first American flag (the Grand Union)
displayed on any of the lakes was by that
arch traitor, Benedict Arnold, on the Royal
Savage. He had command of the fleet on
Lake Champlain in the winter of 1776&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
A man who died without a flag, without a<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">country, without love, without respect.</span>
</p>

<p>The first British man-of-war to enter an
American port after the Revolution was the
Alligator, Capt. Isaac Coffin. He entered
the harbor of Boston on the 2d day of May,
1791. He saluted the American flag on the
fort by firing thirteen guns, which was returned.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
A full report of this occurrence is
to be found in the <em>Columbian Sentinel</em> of
May 3d, 1791.</p>

<p>The first ship to enter a British port after
peace had been declared flying the American
flag was the ship Bedford, of Nantucket,
Capt. William Mooers. She entered the
Thames in February, 1783, and proceeded
up to London. She was loaded with whale
oil. The first publication of the terms of
the treaty of peace was on the 28th day of
January, 1783, the treaty itself having been
made in November, 1782.</p>

<p>The first time the American flag was ever
displayed over conquered territory outside
of the United States was on the 27th day of
April, 1805, during the war between this
country and Tripoli, when, after the capture
of the Tripolitan fortress at Derne, it was
hoisted by Lieutenant Bannon and a Mr.
Mann. This flag has fifteen stripes and fifteen
stars, and was exhibited at a celebration
on the 4th of July, 1820, at Brumfield,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>For ten years prior to the Declaration of
Independence men, in defiance of the Government,
protesting against the oppressive
Stamp Duty Act and other causes, held public
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
demonstrations, at which a liberty pole
would be raised, and flags with devices and
sentences upon them would be carried. Associations
calling themselves &ldquo;Sons of Liberty&rdquo;
were formed, and so tense became the
feeling that the people looked with contempt
both upon king and Parliament. So pronounced
did it become that the obnoxious
act was repealed in 1766, after having been
in operation only four months. But these
associations of &ldquo;Liberty Boys,&rdquo; formed in
1765 in every community from Boston to
Charleston, continued in existence, and
formed the nucleus of the army of the Revolution,
and the very devices and sentences
used in 1766 were afterwards adopted and
put upon their flags in 1775 and 1776 prior
to the adoption of the Grand Union Flag and
the present Ensign.</p>

<p>I have in the foregoing pages endeavored
to collate truly all the documentary and other
tangible evidence that is in existence to fully,
absolutely, and without fear of contradiction,
sustain the contention that the Betsy Ross
claim exists only because of a statement
made by a relative who did not produce one
scintilla of documentary or recorded evidence
to sustain the claim. The records of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the time refute it, and the dates are so at
variance with facts that are known that it is
a surprise that any credence whatever has
been given to the story.</p>

<p>This is God&#8217;s land, overflowing with
promises to the oppressed of all nations.
Our shields have been dented in honorable
warfare to establish individual liberty and
religious freedom, and in all the coming
years may our Government reign supreme
over all this fair land, and everywhere from
ocean to ocean may our flag, like the Bow
of Promise, be a sign to all the people of the
earth that, being heaven-born, it is a covenant
that liberty will and shall be maintained
as long as love of country exists in the breast
of man.</p>
